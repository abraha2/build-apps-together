Hello, everyone. I am currently unactive.
I am starting a youtube channel, and I will upload 
progects (wich I will develop in my videos) when that is running smoothly. when it is, though,
I will try to make some cool programs.
And one more thing.  I actually meant my name to be abraham2.
my username now is just a typo.
